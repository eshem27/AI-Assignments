When using AI to document and analyze data, it's important to remember that while AI can process data efficiently, relying on it without honing your own data handling skills can lead to major issues. Blindly trusting AI means you may miss errors that could fundamentally alter your research. This reliance can erode your analytical skills, making it harder to catch mistakes, track their origins, or understand the data properly. Additionally, for very specific analyses, AI might not fully grasp the nuances of your request, leading to completely different results that don’t align with your goals. It’s vital to balance using AI with your own critical thinking and knowledge.

My advice is, to not forget to use artificial intelligence as an assistant, not as a substitute. AI can be a great data processing tool, but people should not let it do all the work for you. It is also important to check and interpret the results, and not just rely on the final information provided by the AI. This helps not only to avoid mistakes, but also develops the ability to critically approach research.
