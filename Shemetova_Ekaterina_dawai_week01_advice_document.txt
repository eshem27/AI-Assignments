When using AI to document your data, it is essential to strike the right balance. AI can be a great tool for organizing thoughts, generating summaries, and transforming technical language into a more readable format. There is nothing wrong with letting AI help structure the documentation and phrase ideas clearly. However, if the person rely too heavily on AI, especially with prompts like "do all the work for me," he risks getting misleading or inaccurate results. AI might miss nuances or not fully grasp the context of your analysis, leading to potential errors or oversimplifications.

It is important to stay involved in the process. Use AI as an assistant to improve efficiency, but always review and refine the content. Ensure that the AI-generated documentation accurately represents your analysis and that all the important details are captured. By doing so, researcher not only avoid potential mistakes but also keep developing his own analytical and documentation skills, ensuring the final output is both accurate and insightful.
